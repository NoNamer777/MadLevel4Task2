# MAD - Level 4: Task 2

This Mobile Application is developed as part of the introduction to the Mobile Application Development at HvA.
The application is used as an introduction to using local storage to make the data persisted.

This application is to simulate a game of rock, paper, scissors. Users can view the total amount
of wins, losses, and draws, and they're also able to see and wipe the match history.
